Realization of two iconic arcade game - Tetris and Snake

This project was realized for Game Design exam at uni. I have implemented the Snake game; Pong game was implemented by my friend Luca Fulgenzi.
We used the P5 (https://p5js.org/) library, which is really helpfull for games, because it has 2 macro-functions:
* setup()
* draw()
